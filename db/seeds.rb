	aboutme: 'I may do some of the things a computer engineer would do, I may be on the track of having a computer engineering degree, but I am most certainly not a computer engineer by heart. my heart lays in capturing scenes that locks the viewer in a state of total immersion and shuts everything so he can live in this exact moment.  

“cinema became a kind of awakened dream where we could travel in space and time. where we can travel in mind. it has became more than virtual reality, it became a real virtuality” - Jason Silva

I refuse to live life as another ordinary guy with a routine life. I will live outside of the borders set by humans limited perspective on who to live. I will achieve happiness in my own way.“Do not be afraid of death. be afraid of the half-lived life” - Larid Hamilton'  )
